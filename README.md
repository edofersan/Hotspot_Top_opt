# Hotspot_Top_opt
Matlab codes for hotspot analysis to avoid overheating in Topology optimization for Additive Manufacturing
The main code titled 'Hotspot_TO_robust_2D.m' build on the standard 99 line Topology optimization code developed by Andreassen et al. (2011).
The code calls three (nested) functions to perform the hotspot analysis and associated senstivity computations.
